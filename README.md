# ansible
An undertaking in Ansible.

This repo contains a framework for sample custom Ansible plugins and modules. These can be used to create Python programs
for executing tasks that are not yet covered in the prebuilt Ansible modules and package.

This repo also contains an old project that was built by a team of scrappy hopeful people called D-Engine.
D-Engine was meant to create cloud resources and was meant work in a cloud agnostic way.
Some of the playbooks, roles, templates and files created for that project can be found here.
